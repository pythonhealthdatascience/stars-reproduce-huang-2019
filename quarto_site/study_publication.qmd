## Interactive web app

The paper also links to an interactive web app for the model which can be found at: <https://rebrand.ly/desECR11> (which redirects to <https://compneuro.shinyapps.io/desECR11/>).

The simulation also links to <https://beta.cloudes.me/loadShare?simId=17588>, stating that it can provide the details of the simulation (although this link does not work, if you login to CLOUDES, you can identify what appears to be a copy of that model under the ID 17482 or by searching "Huang").
