## 10.45-11.00, 11.35-11.45: Running model with 30 replications and various seeds

Intermittently (condensed to 15 minutes, but was over a longer time) ran the baseline model with several different seeds, but 30 replications. However, we can see this has a fairly minimal impact on the results, with a fairly low peak observed for the AngioINR waiting times in all.

## Timings

```{python, python.reticulate = FALSE}
import sys
sys.path.append('../')
from timings import calculate_times

# Minutes used prior to today
used_to_date = 1228

# Times from today
times = [
    ('10.45', '11.00'),
    ('11.35', '11.45')]

calculate_times(used_to_date, times)
```
