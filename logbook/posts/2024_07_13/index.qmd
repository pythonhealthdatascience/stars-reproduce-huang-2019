## 08.22-08.30: Pulled together uncertain and unmet evaluation components

Pulled together to share with Tom and Alison, to get a second opinion on these, and emailed over a link.

**Badges**:

* <https://pythonhealthdatascience.github.io/stars-reproduce-huang-2019/evaluation/badges.html>
* No uncertainties
* 9 unmet criteria

**STARS framework**:

* <https://pythonhealthdatascience.github.io/stars-reproduce-huang-2019/evaluation/artefacts.html>
* No uncertainities
* 9 unmet criteria

**Reporting guidelines**:

* <https://pythonhealthdatascience.github.io/stars-reproduce-huang-2019/evaluation/reporting.html>
* Five uncertainities as below.
* 4 + 7 unmet criteria

| Item | My comments | Thoughts from Tom/Alison |
| --- | --- | --- |
| STRESS-DES 1.2 Model outputs. Define all quantitative performance measures that are reported, using equations where necessary. Specify how and when they are calculated during the model run along with how any measures of error such as confidence intervals are calculated. | It does describe the measures, and how these are calculated, and so I have said it met these criteria, although I did find it hard to understand/calculate the relative probability of waiting, and would've benefited from further detail/equations | |
| STRESS-DES 1.3 Experimentation aims. If the model has been used for experimentation, state the objectives that it was used to investigate. (A) Scenario based analysis â€“ Provide a name and description for each scenario, providing a rationale for the choice of scenarios and ensure that item 2.3 (below) is completed. |I feel the paper does describe the scenarios clearly - my only hesitation is that I have been unable to successfully implement the exclusive use scenario - but that feels like a coding issue rather than a description issue? As, on the face of it, the article describes everything I need to know. | |
| STRESS-DES 3.2 Pre-processing. Provide details of any data manipulation that has taken place before its use in the simulation, e.g. interpolation to account for missing data or the removal of outliers. | None provided, so presumed not applicable - but hard to say, as maybe there was just unmentioned. But as not possible to know either way, assumed not-applicable | |
| ISPOR SDM 15 Is the model generalizability issue discussed? | Not sure if it is partially or fully met? | |
| ISPOR SDM 12 Is cross validation performed and reported | Is it not met or not applicable? `Introduction`: "In contrast to other healthcare fields, a resource-use optimization model has not been implemented
for comprehensive stroke services." @huang_optimizing_2019 | |
