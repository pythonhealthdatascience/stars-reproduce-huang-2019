## 09.46-09.47: Set Python interpreter

Set Python interpreter (e.g. to render these from RStudio) by clicking on the project in the top right of RStudio, then selecting Project Options > Python, and selecting the quarto_huang_2019 virtual environment I'd set up.

## 09.48-10.21: Returning to troubleshooting R version

Continuing to look at the [instructions for old R releases](https://cloud.r-project.org/bin/linux/ubuntu/olderreleasesREADME.html) from yesterday:

> "As of July 2023, packages for R versions below 4.0 are no longer being updated. R 3.6 packages for Ubuntu on i386 and amd64 are available for most stable Desktop releases of Ubuntu until their official end of life date. However, only the latest Long Term Support (LTS) release is fully supported. As of November 18, 2018 the supported releases are Bionic Beaver (18.04;LTS), Xenial Xerus (16.04; LTS), and Trusty Tahr (14.04; LTS)."

By running `lsb_release -a`, I can see that my linux version is jammy (22.04.4 LTS). Looking at the instructions from [this Stackoverflow post](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/33652219/installing-older-version-of-r), I'm a bit unclear as to whether I can use any of these if they're for older versions of linux.

From [this help post](https://github.com/rstudio/renv/issues/254), I then stumbled across [RStudio r-builds](https://github.com/rstudio/r-builds) which has R builds that say they should install fast on Ubuntu from a .deb file and are designed to easily switch between multiple versions of R. These say they support Ubunutu 22.04. I ran:

```
R_VERSION=3.6.0
curl -O https://cdn.posit.co/r/ubuntu-2204/pkgs/r-${R_VERSION}_1_amd64.deb
sudo apt-get install gdebi-core
sudo gdebi r-${R_VERSION}_1_amd64.deb
```

I confirmed this was installed by running `/opt/R/${R_VERSION}/bin/R --version`.

I then followed their instructions to add R to the system path:

```
sudo ln -s /opt/R/${R_VERSION}/bin/R /usr/local/bin/R 
sudo ln -s /opt/R/${R_VERSION}/bin/Rscript /usr/local/bin/Rscript
```

I restarted RStudio and found I was now in R 3.6.0. I delete the renv (which was built with 4.4.1) and remade it.

```
renv::deactivate(clean=TRUE)
install.packages("renv")
renv::init(bare=TRUE)
renv::snapshot()
```

The lock file now had R 3.6.0 (previously 4.4.1) and renv 1.0.7.

## 10.40-11.30, 11.35-11.41: Installing the packages

I ran `renv::install()` but it failed with: `Warning: failed to find source for 'simmer.plot 0.1.15' in package repositories. Error: failed to retrieve package 'simmer.plot@0.1.15'.`

I then tried with remotes:

```
install.packages("remotes")
remotes::install_version("simmer", "4.2.2")
```

However, this failed like before. Instead, I decided a different tactic - to just download them without the specified versions. I removed the versions from DESCRIPTION and ran `renv::install()`. However, this stopped with an error: `Error: package 'evaluate' is not available`.

I then tried working through each package one by one.

`renv::install("simmer")` was successful.

`renv::install("simmer.plot")` failed with the issue of 'evaluate' is not available. Based on [this StackOverflow post](https://github.com/r-lib/evaluate/issues/52), I tried installing 'stringi' - but that didn't end up helping. I tried install evaluate before and after restarting the R session but still stated as not available.

Uncertain on what else might fix this, I decided to actually just start again from the latest version of R and try installing the packages there and see if I could get it to work without backdating the packages. I closed RStudio and ran the commands as above but changed R_VERSION to 4.4.1. I also couldn't run the commands for symbolic link as it said the files already exist. I restarted R but still 3.6.0. Looking in `/opt/R/`, I can see I now have 3.6.0 and 4.4.1.

Based on the [prior tutorial](https://support.bioconductor.org/p/9157825/) I'd found, I tried:

```
export RSTUDIO_WHICH_R=/opt/R/4.4.1/bin/R
rstudio
```

This worked, although default when open from application bar was still set to 3.6.0. I tried changing the .profile file (`nano .profile`) to add `export RSTUDIO_WHICH_R=/opt/R/4.4.1/bin/R` but made no difference.

I tried forcing replacement of the symbolic links then reopening RStudio:

```
R_VERSION=4.4.1
sudo ln -snf /opt/R/${R_VERSION}/bin/R /usr/local/bin/R 
sudo ln -snf /opt/R/${R_VERSION}/bin/Rscript /usr/local/bin/Rscript
```

This worked! So, trying again (with DESCRIPTION file still containing no versions)...

```
renv::deactivate(clean=TRUE)
install.packages("renv")
renv::init(bare=TRUE)
renv::snapshot()
renv::install()
renv::snapshot()
```

## 11.41-11.46, 11.52-12.00: Try running the code

I copied over `server.R` and, on opening, it said that plyr and shiny were required but not installed, so I add these to the environment as well.

On reflection, I realised that the settings to only store dependencies from DESCRIPTION in renv.lock probably wouldn't be great, in case hidden things were also installed, so changed this setting to "implicit" (which is default).

I ran the file and it did the command shiny, but said `Error: object 'shiny' not found`. I copied over all the files and tried again. It ran the script but nothing happened. Based on the [Shiny documentation](https://shiny.posit.co/r/getstarted/shiny-basics/lesson1/index.html), I moved the files into a folder called app and run the following in R console:

```
library(shiny)
runApp("app")
```

This opened up a shiny app, but got an error "there is no package called ‘markdown’". I add this to the environment and tried again.

This ran the app successfully.

However, from having looked at the app online, I knew that the figures it produced are not what I need to reproduce the results presented in the paper.

## 12.07-

I copied the function `simulate_nav` from `server.R`. Looking through it, there was only one part still using shiny: the Progress bar.
## Timings

```{python}
import sys
sys.path.append('../')
from timings import calculate_times

# Minutes used prior to today
used_to_date = 149

# Times from today
times = [
    ('09.47', '09.48')]

calculate_times(used_to_date, times)
```
