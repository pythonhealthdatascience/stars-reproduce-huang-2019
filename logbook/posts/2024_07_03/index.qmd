## 11.53-12.20, 12.27-: Set-up and update repository

I have previously (Friday 21st June 2024) sent an email to the corresponding author (Dr. Shiwei Huang) to inform about the study, using the template email from our protocol.

Today, used template repository to create this repository and updated it to be relevant to Huang et al. 2019 - updated..

* `README`
* Home page (`index.qmd`)
* Logbook
* `CITATION.cff`
* `_quarto.yml`

From a quick look at their code repository, can see they use a GNU General Public License version 3. The [requirements of this license](https://fossa.com/blog/open-source-software-licenses-101-gpl-v3/) are to:

* Include a copy of the full license
* State all significant changes made to the software
* Make the original source code availble when distributing binaries based on that work
* Include a copy of the original copyright notice

It allows the code to be changed and distributed to others (as long as release under GPL v3 also). Hence, updated license (and references to it) to GNU GPL 3.0 accordingly.

Created environment for book.

## Timings

```{python}
import sys
sys.path.append('../')
from timings import calculate_times

# Minutes used prior to today
used_to_date = 0

# Times from today
times = [
    ('11.53', '12.20')]

calculate_times(used_to_date, times)
```
