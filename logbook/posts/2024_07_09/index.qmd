## 09.04-09.06, 09.14-09.15: Continuing on Figure 2

I was curious to see how a different seed would impact the appearance of the figures, and so tried changing the seed from 200 to 300. However, it looks fairly similar.

And with seed 500 too:

## Untimed: Fixing GitHub commits and action for Quarto book

Had commit the produced .csv files without recognising they were too large. Undid commits with `git reset HEAD^`, and switched reproduction to only save relevant rows and columns, and to save as a compressed `.csv.gz` file. This required adding `R.utils` to the environment.

Also, modified `quarto_publish.yaml` to use `setup-r-dependencies`.
