### Untimed: Set up RStudio and test quarto site with R

I did not time this as it is not specific to this reproduction, but additional set-up as not done reproduction in R yet (since the test-run was conducted in Python).

This involved installing/updating RStudio, learning how to run and work with a quarto book on that platform, and and troubleshooting any issues in getting the quarto book up and running.

This included:

* Updating to the latest version of RStudio, as suggested in the [Quarto docs](https://quarto.org/docs/computations/r.html)
* Installing renv: `install.packages("renv")`
* Setting the working directory: `setwd("~/Documents/stars/stars-reproduce-huang-2019")`
* Initialised an empty R environment: `renv::init(bare=TRUE)`
* Set renv to use explicit dependencies: `renv::settings$snapshot.type("explicit")`
* Created a `DESCRIPTION` file
* Ran `renv::snapshot()` which returned that project is not activated yet, so I selected option to `Activate the project and use the project library`. This generated an `.Rprofile` file.
* I then tried to open the project (`File > Open Project`) but this failed. So I tried `File > New Project > Existing Directory` (which created an `.Rproj` file), then reran `renv::init(bare=TRUE)`, then `renv::snapshot()`, and selected to install packages and then snapshot.
* Synced with GitHub (excluding .Rhistory, which is just a history of executed commands), using Git panel in top right corner

* Installing rmarkdown (and knitr), as in the [Quarto docs](https://quarto.org/docs/computations/r.html) (which took a while)
* Creating an renv for the book
