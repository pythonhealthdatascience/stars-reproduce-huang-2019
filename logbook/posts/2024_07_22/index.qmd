Tom's test run of the model.

:::

## Untimed: Test run by second member of STARS team

Tom attempted to run the model from my `reproduction/` folder.

Was able to run the tests fine, and also ran some of the scripts.

The `renv` install okay - just needed to install some operating system dependencies via `apt`, but likely as that was the first time he'd used R on that machine.

The local build of the docker image worked fine first time. Launched RStudio server and ran testthat without an issue.

Noted that in both cases RStudio was using 8GB RAM.

Wasn't able to run it on his virtual machine (by default, that only allocates 4GB RAM, so that would be why).
