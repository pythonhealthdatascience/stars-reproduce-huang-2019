Redid badge evaluation.

:::

## 09.53-09.57: Revisit evaluation

Revisited and revised the badge criteria to (a) make them up-to-date, and (b) make sure they are *specific* to the descriptions from each badge. Hence, redoing evaluations for all eight studies.

Notes:

* Relevant - yes, as its the model needed, even if it is within an app
* Executes - yes, although required significant troubleshooting, as I had to extract it from app code

Ran this by Tom who agreed. Results remain the same (3 criteria, 0 badge).
