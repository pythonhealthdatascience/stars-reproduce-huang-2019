## Untimed: Amendment to evaluation

I noticed a mistake in my evaluation of the repository against STRESS-DES.

**Criteria:** 5.2 Random sampling

**Original decision:** üü° Partially met - no seeds but describes sampling of arrivals

**New decision:** ‚ùå Not met - as sampling of arrivals wasn't relevant to this criteria (I had misunderstood)

I amended `reporting.qmd`, `reproduction_report.qmd` and [stars_wp1_summary](https://github.com/pythonhealthdatascience/stars_wp1_summary) accordingly.
