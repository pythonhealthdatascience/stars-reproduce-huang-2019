## 09.14-09.17, 09.22-09.24, 09.30-09.35: Continuing on in-text results 1 and 2

Re-ran twice more to see again how much variation we get between runs, and how likely that could attribute for the difference against the paper. We saw-

| Output | Result 1 (Day 3) | Result 2 (Day 3) | Result 3 (Today) | Result 4 (Today) | Paper |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Baseline | 13.33 minutes | 13.65 minutes | 14.15 minutes | 14.09 minutes | - |
| Exclusive | 8.58 minutes (4.75 reduction) | 9.20 minutes (4.45 reduction) | 8.79 minutes (5.36 reduction) | 8.05 minutes (6.04 reduction) | 6 minute reduction from baseline |
| Two AngioINR | 14.86 minutes (1.53 increase) | 13.61 minutes (0.04 reduction) | 14.37 minutes (0.22 increase) | 14.04 minutes (0.05 reduction) | 4 minute reduction from baseline |

Based on this, it's reasonable to assume that a 6 minute reduction can be observed within the variation of model runs (in-text result 1), but that the two angioINR scenario is not matching up.

## Reflections

Environment used does not match up to paper - paper use Simmer version 4.1.0, and otherwise, other versions of packages and of R being used are more recent than publication. It is unlikely that differences in results are due to this (although not impossible). Note trying to revert the environment to older versions as a possible troubleshooting strategy if issues persist, but not yet, due to major challenges found in trying to do so prior.

## 09.50-10.49, 11.02-11.05, 11.13-11.14: Adding seeds

Based on [this tutorial](https://pythonhealthdatascience.github.io/stars-treat-simmer/02_model/03_r_sampling.html), add seeds to the model. This is because the result was only returned by certain runs of the model and not others, so want to add seeds now so can give a seed for which the result is reproduced. I installed simEd - `renv::install("simEd")` and add to `DESCRIPTION` and `renv::snapshot()` - and then made the following changes to the model:

* `library(simEd)`
* Input `seed` to function which becomes SEED, then `set.seed(SEED+i)` within model replications
* Sampling functions changed from `r` to `v` - i.e. `rpois()` to `vpois()`, with incremental stream numbers

I tried running baseline, but it took a long time - after 6 minutes, it was still running (which is normally how long the whole script takes). I interrupted it and it returned `Error : object 'shifts' not found`. However, no change has been made to shifts code. I ran a short section of code practicing sampling and this worked fine:

```
library(simEd)

ed_pt = 107000
year2min = 525600
I_ED  = round(year2min/ed_pt)

set.seed(5)
vpois(10, I_ED, stream=1)

set.seed(3)
vpois(10, I_ED, stream=1)

set.seed(5)
vpois(10, I_ED, stream=1)
```

I then tried running it with 3 replications instead of 30 (`baseline <- run_model(nsim=3, seed=100)`), and that ran fine, so it appears that introducing this library just slowed down the model alot, as 3 replications could complete in 40 seconds.

I looked into changing the `lapply()` in `model.R` to a parallel version:

* `parLapply` requires you to specify every variable to be included, plus additional lines of code to set up and close clusters
* `mcapply()` just requires you to change `lapply`

Hence, I tried `mcapply`, but it returned `Error: external pointer is not valid`, which was resolved based on [this post](https://groups.google.com/g/simmer-devel/c/4cQWtS571iQ?pli=1) by adding `wrap()`. However, learnt that mclapply wouldn't work on Windows. Moreover, it still took a fair while to run (testing with 30 replications, it's still going at 4 minutes).

As such, removed simEd from `model.R` and environment and returned to `rpois()`, and instead just set a simple seed without controlling streams. The time for this to run was as per usual, which was fab. I ran the baseline model twice with the same seed and compared the results, and it came out looking (by eye, at the processed results) identical.

I therefore ran baseline and exclusive with three different starter seeds, and the seed `200` came out closest to the paper -

* Baseline: 13.96 minutes
* Exclusive: 8.12 minutes
* Difference: 5.84 minutes

Hence, I feel we can mark in-text result 1 as reproduced at this time (11.14), with starter seed of 200.

```{python}
import sys
sys.path.append('../')
from timings import calculate_times

# Minutes used prior to today
used_to_date = 443

# Times from today
times = [
    ('09.14', '09.17'),
    ('09.22', '09.24'),
    ('09.30', '09.35'),
    ('09.50', '10.49'),
    ('11.02', '11.05'),
    ('11.13', '11.14')]

calculate_times(used_to_date, times)
```

## 11.15-12.30, 13:15-13.50, 13.55-14.55: Working on Figure 2

Figure 2 uses the results from the scenarios above but creates plots where:

* X axis is wait time in minutes (on a non-linear scale)
* Y axis is standardised density of patients in queue, from 0 to 1 (on a non-linear scale)
  * i.e. "Probability density of patients who are waiting standardised to patients who are not waiting"
  * i.e. "To facilitate graphical and descriptive comparison across models, we express waiting times as relative probabilities of waiting a given amount of time, compared to not waiting at all. Since most patients accessed services without waiting, wait time densities could be directly compared across simulations after this normalization."

It's not immediately clear exactly what this means, but I'll start with creating a density plot of waiting times for one of the resources. First though, I add some code to save the model results to CSV files so that we don't have to re-run the model each time (since with seeds added, it should now come out the same each time anyway). I initially saved these with `write.csv()` but it was too slow, so then (based on [this tutorial](https://medium.com/r-evolution/how-to-export-100x-faster-csv-files-from-r-for-big-data-1d969a6b9269)), I switched to `data.table::fwrite()` ("fast CSV writer"), which was much much better! Hence, used `fread()` to import (as should also be quicker, based on [this tutorial](https://www.r-bloggers.com/2020/09/the-fastest-way-to-read-and-writes-file-in-r/)).

I then created a basic density plot with ggplot with ED AngioINR untransformed wait times.

```
base_angio <- res_base %>% filter(category == "ed") %>% filter(resource == "angio_inr")
p <- ggplot(base_angio, aes(x = wait_time)) +
  geom_density()
ggsave(path_fig2a)
p
```

![Figure 2A raw wait times](fig2a_example1.png)

### Y axis

I played around with various transformations, as it wasn't immediately clear to me how they had stretched the y axis, including creating custom functions, transforming the data directly, and trying out default transform options. I eventually stumbled across `scale_y_continuous(transform="sqrt")`, which matched up to the axis in the paper.

### Standardising the density

I played around with a few different transformation as I tried to work out what they meant by standardised density of patients in queue. Whilst converting raw wait times to probabilities, I noticed a bunch of ever so slightly negative wait times, but given these are very small (i.e. 0.0000000...), I am not concerned.

One thing I tried was converting each wait time into a probability of that wait time (e.g. rounding each to 2dp, then 0 wait time = probability 0.68).

```
# Filter to just AngioINR for ED and round wait times to 2dp
base_angio <- res_base %>%
  filter(category == "ed", resource == "angio_inr") %>%
  select(wait_time)

# Round to 2dp
base_angio$wait_time <- round(base_angio$wait_time, 2)

# Convert raw wait times into probability of waiting that long given all
# wait times observed
prob_wait <- base_angio %>%
  group_by(wait_time) %>%
  summarise(count = n()) %>%
  mutate(probability = count / sum(count)) %>%
  select(wait_time, probability)

ggplot(prob_wait, aes(x=wait_time, y=probability)) + geom_line() + geom_point()
```

However, that really didn't look quite right.

![Figure 2A wrong transformation](fig2a_example2.png)

Looking at the curve with the raw wait times, the shape of the curve is more similar to the paper, just with different y axis and stretched. Revisiting the paper description, it is the "relative probabilities of waiting a given amount of time, compared to not waiting at all". So, it's not just the relative probability of waiting a given amount of time, compared to any other time.

I created a plot where the waiting times were normalised in such a way that the values range from 0 to 1, which starts to look a bit more similar to the paper -

```
# Filter to just AngioINR for ED and round wait times to 2dp
base_angio <- res_base %>%
  filter(category == "ed", resource == "angio_inr")

# Set negative wait times to 0
base_angio$wait_time[base_angio$wait_time < 0] <- 0

# Create the density data
density_data <- density(base_angio$wait_time)

# Normalize the density values
normalized_density <- density_data$y / max(density_data$y)

# Create a data frame with the normalized density values
density_df <- data.frame(x = density_data$x, y = normalized_density)

# Plot using ggplot2
ggplot(density_df, aes(x = x, y = y)) +
  geom_line() +
  scale_y_continuous(transform="sqrt")
ggsave(path_fig2a)
```

![Figure 2A scaled to 0 to 1](fig2a_example3.png)

I then tried creating a dataframe of counts for each wait time, then calculated probability based on number of people with no wait time. However, many were tiny (as count e.g. 1 of wait time 0.00000000000002842171). Tried it with rounding first. However, it is still then the same, as most are just 0, and then e.g. 1 wait time 0.2, 3 wait time 0.5.

```
# Filter to just AngioINR for ED and round wait times to 2dp
base_angio <- res_base %>%
  filter(category == "ed", resource == "angio_inr")

# Set negative wait times to 0
base_angio$wait_time[base_angio$wait_time < 0] <- 0

# Round everything to 1dp
base_angio$wait_time <- round(base_angio$wait_time, 1)

# Get probability of no wait time
n_zero = length(which(base_angio$wait_time == 0))
prob_zero = n_zero / nrow(base_angio)

# Convert dataframe to counts of each wait time
wait_df = base_angio %>%
  group_by(wait_time) %>%
  summarise(count=n())
```

I tried transforming by the density of 0 (`density_data$y[which.min(abs(density_data$x - 0))]`) but that worked out to just be the same as `max(density_data$y)`, since 0 has the max density.

I tried transforming the x axis, which also appears to be a sqrt transformation, although this has an issue of introducing Inf values and losing where x=0 and density=1. I explored a few different ways of doing this transformation to see if anything helps

## 15.10-15.30: Research into transformations

As I'm struggling with these transformations - to the x axis, and to the probability density function. As such, it seems a good idea to do a bit more research into these and what exactly they are doing, to see if that helps.

### Square root axis transformation

I read a few articles and looked at the documentation for the square root transformation, and understand that this simply applying the `sqrt()` function.

You get the same graph if you do this:

```
density_df %>%
  mutate(x_sqrt = sqrt(x)) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x=x_sqrt, y=y)) + geom_line() + xlim(0, sqrt(200)) + scale_y_continuous(transform="sqrt")
```

The only difference is the x axis labels - when we use the ggplot axis transformation, it keeps the old labels to maintain interpretation of the original data.

### Density functions

A probability density function is used to describe a continuous distribution. It can be used to find the likelihood of values of a continuous random variable.

`ggplot::geom_density()` is described as plotting a smoothed version of the histogram.

## 15.31-16.55: Returning to Figure 2

I add the sqrt x axis transformation to the basic density plot, and suddenly got a result that looked alot like the article! The only differences are the range of each axis, and the min/max values for y (ranges from 0 to 0.2...)

```
# Filter to just AngioINR for ED and round wait times to 2dp
base_angio <- res_base %>%
  filter(category == "ed", resource == "angio_inr")

# Set negative wait times to 0
base_angio$wait_time[base_angio$wait_time < 0] <- 0

ggplot(base_angio, aes(x = wait_time)) +
  geom_density() +
  scale_y_continuous(transform="sqrt") +
  scale_x_continuous(transform="sqrt")
```

![Figure 2A... getting closer!](fig2a_example4).png

I tried out using previous transforms but they didn't look right. Then I came across [this stack Overflow post](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/51385455/geom-density-y-axis-goes-above-1) which suggested you can scale the density estimate to a maximum of one by inputting `..scaled..`. This is the computed `..scaled..` value from `geom_density()` which provides the density estimate scaled to a maximum of 1. From the [documentation](https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/reference/aes_eval.html), can see that `..scaled..` has been replaced with `after_stat(scaled)`.

This is however assuming that scaling to 1 is the same as scaling by probability of 0 wait time (which is at least true in this case, as we saw above).

```
# Filter to just AngioINR for ED and round wait times to 2dp
base_angio <- res_base %>%
  filter(category == "ed", resource == "angio_inr")

# Set negative wait times to 0
base_angio$wait_time[base_angio$wait_time < 0] <- 0

# Create the plot, scaling the density estimate to a maximum of 1
ggplot(base_angio, aes(x=wait_time, y=after_stat(scaled))) +
  geom_density() +
  scale_y_continuous(transform="sqrt") +
  scale_x_continuous(transform="sqrt")
```

![Figure 2A example 5](fig2a_example5.png)

I tried adding all the resources in to the plots, and converting it into a function so I can apply it to all three dataframes. To easily show the plots side-by-side with a shared legend, I installed the package ggpubr.

Installation of ggpubr failed with message `ERROR: configuration failed for package ‘nloptr’`. It suggested I install cmake so, as prompted, I ran `sudo apt install cmake`. This then installed fine.

Creating the plots and making various tweaks to the plotting and appearance, we're getting a bit closer to the paper.

```
create_plot <- function(df, title, xlim=c(0, 200)) {
  #' Create sub-plots for Figure 2A
  #' 
  #' @param df Dataframe with wait times across replications
  #' @param xlim Tuple with limits for x axis

  # Filter to just ED
  base_angio <- df %>%
    filter(category == "ed")
  
  # Set negative wait times to 0
  base_angio$wait_time[base_angio$wait_time < 0] <- 0
  
  # Create the plot, scaling the density estimate to a maximum of 1
  ggplot(base_angio, aes(x = wait_time,
                         colour = resource,
                         y = after_stat(scaled))) +
    geom_density() +
    # Apply square transformation to each axis, removing x points beyond limits
    scale_y_continuous(transform = "sqrt") +
    scale_x_continuous(transform = "sqrt",
                       breaks = scales::breaks_width(50),
                       limits = xlim,
                       oob = scales::censor,
                       guide = guide_axis(angle=45)) +
    # Titles and styling
    ggtitle(title) +
    xlab("") +
    ylab("") +
    theme_bw(base_size=10)
}

p1 <- create_plot(res_base, title="Baseline")
p2 <- create_plot(res_exc, title="Exclusive-use", xlim=c(0, 250))
p3 <- create_plot(res_two, title="Double angio INRs")
ggarrange(p1, p2, p3, nrow=1, common.legend=TRUE, legend="bottom", labels=c("A", "B", "C"))
ggsave(path_fig2a)
