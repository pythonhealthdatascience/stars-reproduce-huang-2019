Working on research compendium stage

:::

## Untimed: Research compendium

* Tried adding parallel processing in `model.R` to speed it up
  * Add `future.apply` to the environment
  * `plan(multisession, workers=max(availableCores()-5, 1))`
  * `future_lapply()`
  * However, it took longer than usual! So I removed it
* Reorganising
  * Moved scripts into a `scripts/` folder
  * Moved help functions from `reproduction.Rmd` into seperate R script (primarily so can reuse in tests more easily)
* Set `ggsave()` image width as realised it otherwise varied with window size when running
