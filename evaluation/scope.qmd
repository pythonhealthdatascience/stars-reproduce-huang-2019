## In-text result 1

"Exclusive-Use Scenario. In this scenario, the overall wait time probability at angioINR was reduced compared to baseline (red line in Figure 2B compared to Figure 2A). This represents a **decrease in ECR patient wait time for angioINR by an average of 6 min**." @huang_optimizing_2019

## In-text result 2

"Two angioINRs Scenario. This scenario simulates the effect a facility upgrade to two biplane angiographic suites, but without additional staff changes. The wait time probability at angioINR was reduced compared to baseline (Figure 2C). The reduction represents an **average of 4 min less in queue for angioINR**." @huang_optimizing_2019

## In-text result 3

"Extended Schedule Scenario. The wait time probability at angioINR in the exclusive- use scenario was further reduced by extended work hours (Figure 3B). In contrast, work extension did not affect baseline or the 2 angioINRs scenario (Figures 3A,C). For the baseline scenario, 1 and 2 h of extra work resulted in an **average wait time of 1.7 and 0.9 min reduction, respectively**. For the 2 angioINRs scenario, 1 and 2 h of extra work resulted in an **average wait time gain of 1 and 0.3 min, respectively**." @huang_optimizing_2019
