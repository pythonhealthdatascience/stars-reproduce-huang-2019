This page evaluates the extent to which the journal article meets the criteria from two discrete-event simulation study reporting guidelines:

* @monks_strengthening_2019 - STRESS-DES: Strengthening The Reporting of Empirical Simulation Studies (Discrete-Event Simulation) (Version 1.0).
* @zhang_reporting_2020 - The generic reporting checklist for healthcare-related discrete event simulation studies derived from the the International Society for Pharmacoeconomics and Outcomes Research Society for Medical Decision Making (ISPOR-SDM) Modeling Good Research Practices Task Force reports.

## STRESS-DES

Of the **24** items in the checklist:

* **14** were met fully (✅)
* **5** were partially met (🟡)
* **4** were not met (❌)
* **1** was not applicable (N/A)

| Item | Recommendation | Met by study? | Evidence |
| - | - | - | - |
| **Objectives** | 
| 1.1 Purpose of the model | Explain the background and objectives for the model | ✅ Fully | `Introduction`: "Endovascular clot retrieval (ECR) is the first-line treatment for acute ischemic stroke (AIS) due to arterial large vessel occlusion (LVO) with several trials demonstrating its efficacy in reducing mortality and morbidity (1–3). However, ECR is considerably more costly than traditional care (4), with estimated procedure costs ranging between 9,000 and 14,000 US dollars per patient (4, 5). Major expenditure is required for capital equipment such as angiography equipment purchase and maintenance. Staffing must be adequate to deliver a 24/7 rapid response service. Government funding agencies seek to optimize return on investment, such as that on resources allocated to acute stroke services. In contrast to other healthcare fields, a resource-use optimization model has not been implemented for comprehensive stroke services."<br><br>@huang_optimizing_2019 |
| 1.2 Model outputs | Define all quantitative performance measures that are reported, using equations where necessary.  Specify how and when they are calculated during the model run along with how any measures of error such as confidence intervals are calculated. | ✅ Fully | `Outcome Measures`: "We examined two outcome measures in this model: the patient wait time and resource utilization rate. “Patient wait time” is the time spent queuing for a resource. “Resource utilization rate” represents the median occupancy rate."<br><br>`Statistics and software`: "To facilitate graphical and descriptive comparison across models, we express waiting times as relative probabilities of waiting a given amount of time, compared to not waiting at all."<br><br>@huang_optimizing_2019 |
| 1.3 Experimentation aims | If the model has been used for experimentation, state the objectives that it was used to investigate.<br>(A) Scenario based analysis – Provide a name and description for each scenario, providing a rationale for the choice of scenarios and ensure that item 2.3 (below) is completed.<br>(B) Design of experiments – Provide details of the overall design of the experiments with reference to performance measures and their parameters (provide further details in data below).<br>(C) Simulation Optimisation – (if appropriate) Provide full details of what is to be optimised, the parameters that were included and the algorithm(s) that was be used.  Where possible provide a citation of the algorithm(s). | ✅ Fully  | All scenarios are described and justified.<br><br>`Results`: "To investigate why a bottleneck exists at angioINR, we tested three scenarios with varying degrees of patient accessibility to angioINR. First, in the “exclusive-use” scenario, angioINR is not available for elective IR patients. Its use is restricted to stroke, elective INR and emergency IR patients. Second, in the “two angioINRs” scenario, the angioIR is replaced with an angioINR, doubling angiography availability for ECR patients. Lastly, in the “extended schedule” scenario, day time working hours of all human resources are extended by up to 2 h, extending resource access to all patients."<br><br>`Results: Using DES to Predict Future Resource Usage`: "Since acquiring data for this study, the demands for ECR at our Comprehensive Stroke Service has doubled between 2018 and 19 and is predicted to triple by the end of 2019. We simulated these increased demands on the resource."<br><br>@huang_optimizing_2019 |
| **Logic** |
| 2.1 Base model overview diagram | Describe the base model using appropriate diagrams and description.  This could include one or more process flow, activity cycle or equivalent diagrams sufficient to describe the model to readers.  Avoid complicated diagrams in the main text.  The goal is to describe the breadth and depth of the model with respect to the system being studied. | ✅ Fully | Figure 1:<br>![Figure 1: A schematic diagram of our discrete event model of an ECR service from Emergency to angiography suite](../original_study/fig1.jpg){.lightbox}<br><br>@huang_optimizing_2019 |
| 2.2 Base model logic | Give details of the base model logic. Give additional model logic details sufficient to communicate to the reader how the model works. | ✅ Fully | Detailed in `Methods: Model Algorithm` |
| 2.3 Scenario logic | Give details of the logical difference between the base case model and scenarios (if any).  This could be incorporated as text or where differences are substantial could be incorporated in the same manner as 2.2. | ✅ Fully | As in 1.3. |
| 2.4 Algorithms | Provide further detail on any algorithms in the model that (for example) mimic complex or manual processes in the real world (i.e.  scheduling of arrivals/ appointments/ operations/ maintenance, operation of a conveyor system, machine breakdowns, etc.). Sufficient detail should be included (or referred to in other published work) for the algorithms to be reproducible.  Pseudo-code may be used to describe an algorithm. | 🟡 Partially | `Methods: Model Properties: Patients`: "Patients are generated by a Poissone process with an inter-arrival time as specified in Table 1."<br>![Table 1. DES model inputs](../original_study/tab1.jpg)<br>@huang_optimizing_2019 <br><br>Doesn't describe some of the other processes from the code (e.g. sampling appointment length, or intricacies of how the suspected stroke / AIS / ECR are not directly inter-arrival time but instead probability based). |
| 2.5.1 Components - entities | Give details of all entities within the simulation including a description of their role in the model and a description of all their attributes. | ✅ Fully | Describes all four patient types in `Methods: Model Algorithm` - "(1) a stroke pathway, (2) an elective non-stroke interventional neuroradiology (elective INR) pathway, (3) an emergency interventional radiology (emergency IR) pathway and (4) an elective interventional radiology (elective IR) pathway."<br><br>@huang_optimizing_2019 |
| 2.5.2 Components - activities | Describe the activities that entities engage in within the model. Provide details of entity routing into and out of the activity. | ✅ Fully | Described in `Methods: Model Algorithm` and visualised in `Figure 1`.<br>![Figure 1: A schematic diagram of our discrete event model of an ECR service from Emergency to angiography suite](../original_study/fig1.jpg){.lightbox}<br><br>@huang_optimizing_2019 |
| 2.5.3 Components - resources | List all the resources included within the model and which activities make use of them. | ✅ Fully | `Methods`:  "resources represent human and physical resources such as interventional radiologist (IR), interventional neuroradiologist (INR), stroke physician, nurse, radiology technologist, CT scanner, single plane (angioIR), and biplane (angioINR) angiography suites."<br><br>Used described in `Methods: Model Algorithm` and visualised in `Figure 1`.<br>![Figure 1: A schematic diagram of our discrete event model of an ECR service from Emergency to angiography suite](../original_study/fig1.jpg){.lightbox}<br><br>@huang_optimizing_2019 |
| 2.5.4 Components - queues | Give details of the assumed queuing discipline used in the model (e.g. First in First Out, Last in First Out, prioritisation, etc.). Where one or more queues have a different discipline from the rest, provide a list of queues, indicating the queuing discipline used for each.  If reneging, balking or jockeying occur, etc., provide details of the rules. Detail any delays or capacity constraints on the queues. | ✅ Fully | `Methods: Model Properties: Queueing`: "In the real world, resources are preferentially given to emergency patients over elective or non-emergency patients. In our model, emergency IR and stroke patients have higher priority than elective patients for resources. Specifically, angioINRs are capable of both INR and IR procedures, although all patient types can utilize this resource, stroke patients have priority compared to other patient types. Emergency IR patients are next in line, followed by elective patients. For example, if a stroke patient and an emergency IR patient enter a queue with 10 elective patients for angioINR, the stroke patient will automatically be placed in front of the queue followed by the emergency IR patient. For an angiography machine for IR procedures only (angioIR), emergency IR patients have priority over elective IR patients. When no resources are available, but multiple resource choices are present, a patient automatically enters the resource queue with the least number of entities (i.e., the shortest queue)."<br><br>@huang_optimizing_2019 |
| 2.5.5 Components - entry/exit points | Give details of the model boundaries i.e. all arrival and exit points of entities.  Detail the arrival mechanism (e.g. ‘thinning’ to mimic a non-homogenous Poisson process or balking) | ✅ Fully | Easily understood from Figure 1.<br>![Figure 1: A schematic diagram of our discrete event model of an ECR service from Emergency to angiography suite](../original_study/fig1.jpg){.lightbox}<br><br>@huang_optimizing_2019 |
