## Time-to-completion

```{python}
import numpy as np
import pandas as pd
from time_to_complete import process_times, success_static, success_interactive

# List of time to complete each item
time_list = [
    [516, 'In-text result 1'],
    [1193, 'In-text result 2'],
    [1450, 'Figure 2'], # Finished work, not completed, adjust to set to NaN
    [np.nan, 'Figure 3'],
    [np.nan, 'Figure 4'],
    [1228, 'Figure 5'],
    [np.nan, 'Supplementary figure'],
    [np.nan, 'In-text result 3']]
times_df = process_times(time_list, adjust='Figure 2')
```

Non-interactive plot:

```{python}
success_static(times_df)
```

Interactive plot:

```{python}
success_interactive(times_df)
```

### In-text result 1

**Consensus: Successfully reproduced**

"Exclusive-Use Scenario. In this scenario, the overall wait time probability at angioINR was reduced compared to baseline (red line in Figure 2B compared to Figure 2A). This represents a **decrease in ECR patient wait time for angioINR by an average of 6 min**." @huang_optimizing_2019

Reproduction:

```{python}
txt12 = pd.read_csv('../reproduction/outputs/txt2.csv')
txt12[txt12['scenario'].isin(['Baseline', 'Exclusive use'])]
```

### In-text result 2

**Consensus: Successfully reproduced**

"Two angioINRs Scenario. This scenario simulates the effect a facility upgrade to two biplane angiographic suites, but without additional staff changes. The wait time probability at angioINR was reduced compared to baseline (Figure 2C). The reduction represents an **average of 4 min less in queue for angioINR**." @huang_optimizing_2019

Reproduction:

```{python}
pd.read_csv('../reproduction/outputs/txt2.csv')
txt12[txt12['scenario'].isin(['Baseline', 'Two AngioINRs'])]
```

### In-text result 3

**Consensus: Not reproduced**

"Extended Schedule Scenario. The wait time probability at angioINR in the exclusive- use scenario was further reduced by extended work hours (Figure 3B). In contrast, work extension did not affect baseline or the 2 angioINRs scenario (Figures 3A,C). For the baseline scenario, 1 and 2 h of extra work resulted in an **average wait time of 1.7 and 0.9 min reduction, respectively**. For the 2 angioINRs scenario, 1 and 2 h of extra work resulted in an **average wait time gain of 1 and 0.3 min, respectively**." @huang_optimizing_2019

Reproduction:

```{python}
txt3 = pd.read_csv('../reproduction/outputs/txt3.csv')
txt3[txt3['scenario'].isin(['Baseline', 'Two AngioINRs'])]
```
